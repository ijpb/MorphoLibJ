/**
 * <p>
 * Defines the interface for geodesic reconstructions algorithms applied to
 * planar images.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are currently four implementation of geodesic reconstruction for planar
 * images:
 * <ul>
 * <li>GeodesicReconstructionByDilation: implements reconstruction by dilation,
 * using scanning algorithm</li>
 * <li>GeodesicReconstructionByErosion: implements reconstruction by erosion,
 * using scanning algorithm</li>
 * <li>GeodesicReconstructionScanning: implements reconstruction by dilation or
 * erosion, using scanning algorithm.</li>
 * <li>GeodesicReconstructionHybrid: implements reconstruction by dilation or
 * erosion, using a classical forward pass, a backward pass that initialize a
 * processing queue, and processes each pixel in the queue until it is empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The most versatile one is the "Hybrid" version.
